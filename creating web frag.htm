	<u>Future of Fashion</u>

		If one ascribes to the theory that humans became the dominant species on Earth largely due to having the highest intellectual abilities, then what happens when artificial intelligence (AI) exceeds that of human intelligence? If technological singularity is achieved, will it be the inflection point that will ultimately lead to improvement of the human condition? Or is there reason to fear that AI will lead to a dystopian future with artificially intelligent robots and machines running amok as fictionalized by films such as The Matrix, Blade Runner, The Terminator, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, as well as the science-fiction television series Westworld? Here are twenty of the best quotes on artificial intelligence from notable thinkers.

Fashion intelligence platform Stylumia — founded by former Myntra executive Ganesh Subramanian — is forsaying into UK and European markets as it looks to boost its growth.
<p>
Incorporated in December 2015 by Subramanian along with entrepreneur Ram Prakash H, the company is now seeing 20x growth from over 40 clients such as Aeropostale, Myntra, Wrogn, Fastrack, W, Biba, Global Desi and Puma.
<p>
The Bengaluru-based startup is now looking at entering US in the next few months. "We have been waiting for the right time and maturity and this is the right time to venture and explore international markets," said Subramanian.
<p>
Aimed at helping fashion and lifestyle businesses take future decisions, the company has partnered with stalwarts from the fashion industry to enter new markets.
